# Hackathon - AWS Amplify

## Part 1: Introduction to AWS

AWS can be daunting because there are so many tools and services out there. Start by watching Fireship's video [Top 50+ AWS Services Explained in 10 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIbIYCM48to&t=1s) to get your bearings.

## Part 2: Create your AWS account

Create your AWS account by following the relevant [getting started guide](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/guides/setup-environment/?pg=gs&sec=gtkaws). (Note: You don't need to set up the Cloud9 IDE as you'll be using VS Code as your IDE as normal.)

What we're doing today will fall under the free tier (details [here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all)), but if you're concerned, use the [AWS Budgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) tool. 

Once you've set up your account, use the AWS Management Console [getting started guide](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/getting-started-with-aws-management-console/?pg=gs&sec=gtkaws) to explore. In addition, read [this article](https://dev.to/aws-heroes/stop-aws-account-hacks-1bim) on AWS account security good practices.

## Part 3: Try out Amplify

Watch the short [Intro to AWS Amplify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRbGMZ9oPjw) and [What is AWS Amplify? Pros and Cons?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkbjHtG_d7w) videos as an introduction to Amplify itself.

Then follow the [Amplify with React tutorial](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/react/) to create your first full stack application with the AWS Amplify CLI.

## Bonus: Keep going!

Once you've completed the tutorial above and have your app up and running, keep exploring! Ideas include:

- Customize the todo list app. 
- Research more about GraphQL both by Googling and by exploring the [Amplify GraphQL API docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/getting-started/q/platform/js/). What are the pros and cons when comparing it to REST? Can you add additional CRUD route requests to the todo list application? 
- You can also use Amplify to create a REST back end. Use the [docs here](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/restapi/getting-started/q/platform/js/) to try it out.
- Go deeper into the [Amplify Authentication library](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/js/#create-authentication-service) and see if you can customise the auth in your app.
- Explore other [Amplify libraries](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/q/platform/js/). What else can you add?
- Once you feel comfortable with Amplify, you can research and explore other AWS services as well. What are the most commonly used? What would fit with your use case of a full stack app with a React front end, server, and database if you weren't using Amplify?
